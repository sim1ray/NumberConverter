# NumberConverter

This application uses Java GUI to convert between different number representations. 
The user can enter a value in any one of the following formats: decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal, characters, color, or floating point decimal. 
Once the user enters a value and clicks "Convert", all other values are filled out after doing the appropriate conversion. 
Color is converted according to its pixel value, floating point decimal is converted according to the IEEE 754 standard of arithmetic, and 
characters are converted based on their ASCII notation. 
The "Clear" button resets the form.
